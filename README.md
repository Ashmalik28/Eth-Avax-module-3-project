## Technologies Used 

This project used the following technologies:

- **Solidity**: Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. It is used to write the "Myproject" smart contract in this project. 

- **Web3.js**: Web3.js is a JavaScript library that allows developers to interact with Ethereum and other blockchain networks by providing an easy-to-use interface to interact with smart contracts, manage accounts, and send transactions. It is an essential tool for building decentralized applications (DApps) and integrating blockchain functionality into web applications.

- **MetaMask**: MetaMask is a popular browser extension wallet that allows users to manage Ethereum accounts and interact with decentralized applications. It is used to connect to the Ethereum Goerli network and perform transactions in this project. 

- **Truffle**: Truffle is a development framework for Ethereum smart contracts that simplifies the process of building, testing, and deploying decentralized applications (DApps). It provides a suite of tools and utilities that streamline the development workflow, enabling developers to focus on writing smart contracts and frontend code without worrying about complex configurations.
