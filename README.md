## Functionality

- **Minting Tokens:** The owner of the contract can mint new ASHYAM tokens by calling the mint function. This function creates new tokens and adds them to the balance of the specified address.

- **Burning Tokens:** Token holders can burn their ASHYAM tokens by calling the burn function. This function removes tokens from the caller's balance and reduces the total supply.

- **Transferring Tokens:** Users can transfer ASHYAM tokens to other addresses using the transfer function. This function transfers a specified amount of tokens from the caller's balance to the recipient's balance.

- **Approving Allowances:** Token holders can approve other addresses to spend a certain number of ASHYAM tokens on their behalf using the approve function. This function sets the allowance for the spender.

- **Transferring from Allowance:** Spenders with an approved allowance can transfer tokens from the owner's balance to another address using the transferFrom function.
